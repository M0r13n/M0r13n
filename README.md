# Ahoy!
I am a DevOps Engineer based in Kiel, Germany.
I spend most of my time automating things.

I can offer:
- several years of experience in hydro acoustic systems for naval, hydro graphic and commercial applications as a DevOps Engineer
- advanced level Python programming skills
- experience across the entire Linux stack(kernel, networking, containerization to applications)
- practical knowledge in managing highly available systems
- experience in Open source software involvement

Professionally I'm interested in:
- Python

- DevOps/NetOps
- Infrastructure as Code
- cloud computing technology
- (networking) protocols

In my spare time I:
- am interested in politics
- like to learn about economics, health and history
- listen to to **a lot** of Podcasts
- I seek balance in nature, together with my dog
